## Approach To The Assignment

- As already mentioned in the description of the assignment, I will be using Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind Css for styling.
- In order to show show movies and trailer of movies I will be getting data using [TMDB API]("https://www.themoviedb.org/")
- I will be using Redux toolkit as a state management tool to store data fetched from TMDB API and other app configs.
- To play videos I will be using iFrame and React Player
- To show the movie detail component I will be using material ui modal api.
- For icons I will be using React Icons
- To store the API safely I will be using .env file.
